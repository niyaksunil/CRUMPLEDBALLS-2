MatterJSBoilerPlate

 In this project I created a simple game of throwing crumpled paper balls in a waste paper basket.

I created a dustbin class, a paper class and also a box class in which the box is invisible.

I added the image for the dustbin and also an image  for the paper. On the press of Up Arrow 

paper ball  lands in the dustbin.
